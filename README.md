Pod-To-HTMLBody
=======

Generates a HTML <body/> fragment

Please note that there's a Pod::To::Tree module that will get broken out once
it handles the test cases, and Pod::To::HTMLBody will use that instead of
surrounding the ::To::Tree module.

Installation
============

* Using zef (a module management tool bundled with Rakudo Star):

```
    zef install Pod::To::HTMLBody
```
